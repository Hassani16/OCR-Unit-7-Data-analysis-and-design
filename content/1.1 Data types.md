We need to gather Data properly so we can give it context and analysis so it becomes actionable knowledge and help us make wise decisions.

 (e.g. the colour of products, the
names of employee

## Structured

<https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/structured-data/>

This data is organised in a predefined way with a structure declaring what each piece of data should contain and what format it is in. This gives it context and means it is information.



## Unstructured

Unstructured data is information with no set data definition,schema or model, or data that has not yet been processed into structured data. 

Unstructured data includes:

* Text files
* Video files
* Reports
* Email
* Images

Businesses create huge amounts of data all the time. The less than 20% of that new data is Structured. 

Almost all unstructured data is qualitative but there are some numbers (quanititive data) buried in there.

You need to put lots of effort into getting data out of an Unstructured source that fits a particular context. Searching all your emails for a phone number you could have put in your phone contacts.

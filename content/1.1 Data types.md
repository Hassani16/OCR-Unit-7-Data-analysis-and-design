## Unstructured

Unstructured data is information with no set data definition,schema or model, or data that has not yet been processed into structured data. 

Unstructured data includes:

* Text files
* Video files
* Reports
* Email
* Images

Businesses create huge amounts of data all the time. The less than 20% of that new data is Structured. 

Almost all unstructured data is qualitative but there are some numbers (quanititive data) buried in there.

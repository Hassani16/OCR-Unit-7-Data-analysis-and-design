It was only after watching us win the Challenge Cup final in 1998 on TV that I really caught the bug. I don't remember too many games before 1998, but I really began to get into it after that. From that moment on after the huge upset which, as a youngster, seeing the team I had been watching for a few years go on to cause a major national sporting upset made me really proud and I'd say from that day I became a thorough Eagles fan. However, with the merger with Huddersfield, my family decided to boycott the merged team's games. Unfortunately, being a kid and no longer going and being heartbroken about losing our team put me off rugby league for a few years and didn't go back to watch the new Eagles from 2000 onwards. However, I attended a Red Hot Chilli Peppers concert at DVS in July 2006 and met some Leeds Rhinos fans who were talking to me about the Challenge Cup final in 98. They told me the Eagles were towards the top of League Two on a long winning streak. This encouraged me to go back to a few games that season. These were Swinton, Blackpool and Dewsbury at home. Seeing us beat Dewsbury in the last minute with a Brendon Lindsay drop goal was something I will never forget as they were the runaway leaders at the time. In the 2007 season I went to most home games and in 2008 I got a season ticket as I have done every year since. I guess the Eagles are synonymous with me for always battling against the odds not being from the heartlands and not having as many fans as heartland teams. Yet, despite these issues our teams always have fight, play good attacking rugby and always seem to end up winning silverwear. In addition, I have huge respect for Mark Aston. To see how much work he has put into the club inspires me to keep turning up even during the bad days (2016,2018).",,"Talking with people who aren't supporters about the project, getting them involved",I guess if there is a scheme the project could do whereby it works with the club to provide ticket discounts to people who know an Eagles fan for them to get a taste of a game.

And similarly for the Eagles I think the timing is right following the struggle on and off the field over the last 9 years. I think with the new stadium in Sheffield it is time to rediscover much of the identity that I think the club has lost.","Of course there is a need. The Eagles before 2016 were very much a community focused club. I think reaching out to people through this project, people who may have lost contact with the club, is crucial. This is particularly so at a time where many people are struggling mentally as a result of the pandemic. For some re-connecting with the club and re-sparking that interest could be beneficial for their mental wellbeing. ",,Male,16-25,White,S13,,,

9/8/2021 16:33:33,A Sheffield Eagles fan who doesn't currently attend games but plans to in the future,1984 - 1990,Someone who occasionally attends home games,2019,I played for the Junior Eagles ,1998,"Yes, Loads of programmes.

I do have something I consider really special,  I would loan to the project. When the team beat Chorley Borough at Owlerton in 1989, I was pitchside with a few of the other Junior Eagles' youngsters and Gary Hetherington asked us not to invade the pitch until the cameras had captured the moment and celebrations.   We obliged and we were invited on to celebrate with the players once the cameras had done.  We went on the sludgy pitch and celebrated, Tubby gave me the last slaver of champagne  from  a bottle.  I saved that bottle, and still have it.  Happy to loan it, but wouldn't want to give it up, Thanks to finding Rugby League through Sheffield Eagles and Junior Eagles, 1989 was one of the happiest, most memorable years of my youth! ","Sheffield Eagles were paramount to my social development.  I'm from Rotherham and all my friends were into footy, I was crap at it.   I then met Ged Morrow, who was  a coach at the Junior Eagles, under the Sheffield and district development programme headed by (initially) Tim Butcher.  I quickly became hooked on the sport and got a season ticket, and traveled to a lot of the away games as well.   I made friends for life.  I did play  a season for the academy and although I didn't spend loads of time around the first team, I bumped in to Mark Aston at Winter Wonderland in London in 2019,   who remembered me and we had a brief discussion about what Corey was upto etc.  Sheffield Eagles mean a lot to me.   ","The nomadic years (past and current), Local grass roots successes Jason Davidson and Rich Armswood.  Joe Dakitoga's age story.   Big name signings - Cliff Lyons, Garry Jack, Hugh Waddell, Lee Jackson.  The went on to achieve greatness stories - Keith Senior, Tawera Nikau. ","Being part of the project steering group, Taking part in researching the history of the club, Carrying out interviews with players, staff or supporters to gather their stories, Taking part in researching the history of the area","Personally, I would like to reignite my love of the game, I'm now a football fan; sadly I feel the game of Rugby League is not what it used to be.   As I feel this way there must be many others that feel the same, I remember owlerton having decent(ish) numbers of supporters in attendance.  Maybe if some of these could be engaged, they would come along with their kids and grandkids, so perhaps the heritage project could provoke a feeling of nostalgia and bring people back to the Eagles. ","I do, but I feel this needs to be developed in conjunction with the development of the club and its long term strategy.  The project should be launched as the team performances become consistent and display determination.     

As stated in my last answer,  a well thought through project may re-engage people who have drifted away.  I haven't seen any of the recent games, but follow closely on social media and reading the comments 'lackluster' is a (nice) word I'd use to describe the performances.  If the club want old-school fans to return, there needs to be 'fire in the bellys attitude of the team'.  I remember Mark Aston on 'Scrumdown' saying something along the line of ""we need to go out there and bust some heads""  Obviously, no heads were 'busted' but it was said with passion, that's what the old schoolers want to see.  If effort and passion is displayed week on week, as long as every game isn't a loss, I think there'd be a chance of winning back some of the people that this project should engage.  ","Whether it is the heritage project or the club that should do this, I think an opportunity has been missed over recent years.  There are a fair few SY amateur clubs that  are in existence, or no longer exist.

Why not organise 're-union' afternoons for these groups of players, offering free tickets, to get them through the gate?  Only one team per game, but it will be old friends meeting up for  a drink and a pie, watching the game.  Perhaps if the club will make money from food and drink sales at the legacy park, it would be more advantageous waiting until then, but again this project could bring people back to the club.

As part of this I was given a half price voucher for the remainder of the 1988/89 season.  I went to a few matches and got hooked.","The victory against Widnes 31-06 at Bramall Lane in the 1989/90 season, our first in the top flight.  The match was only a few days after Widnes had won the world club championship, and were considered almost unbeatable.","I have a number of programmes from the late 80's onwards.

In the past, when I lived in Sheffield, I followed the club home and away.  Since moving away from the city, it is a reason to go back, to see my family and to watch a match with my Dad. I have never really sort to be anything other than a supporter, going to those matches I can, but this support has been an important part of my life.","I am not sure I have stories really.  There were a couple of amusing incidents when I first watched games back at Owlerton, David Nelson turning up late for a game because the clocks had changed and he had not noticed.  My memory is not great, but there was a book celebrating the first 1st decade of the club, written by John Cornwell and Richard Pepper, which has some interesting snippets. 
The club has had some significant links to the game in South Yorkshire, with Hillsborough Hawks, forming out of the Junior Eagles set up around 1993 or 1994, and numerous links to other amateur teams.  I think this area deserves to be mentioned.",Attending events and talks about the history of the club,"For me personally, it would be nice to have the importance of the club to those people involved highlighted.  Also, to fill in some gaps in my knowledge and memories.
For the sport in general I think it is important to highlight the importance it has on a community, to record the history.  Rugby League does not keep records well, or at least not publically, and I think that is a shame, there is much to be proud of.
For the club ti is important to reconnect to the community, the years of not having a home in our city has hurt us, and that reconnection is important, we are a club for the community and looking back reminds us of that.",,Thank you for taking on this project.,Male,40-49,White,LE12,,,

I think from the stories I have heard from others the 1895 cup might have topped this but it was the day I came back from my holiday so could only watch it in Manchester station screaming to everyone there in elation as we won. The two years were we won the grand final were by far the best in my memory though because as a 15/16 year old, watching those games was so elating. I kept telling Mum that we would win the teams in those final games when it really mattered and we did just that. Watching the teams back then achieve that when things weren't going the best way for us in terms of our home ground gave me hope for the future and opened my eyes to a rugby league family that to this day still exists. It's when I first realised why my mum, grandad and auntie had watched them for that many years prior because being part of a crowd cheering on a team that showed passion and resilience was so elating and made me feel like I had found my forever sport and team (hopefully).",N/A,"The Sheffield Eagles are more to me now than just watching a sport and club that I love. I have made so many friends along my 13 year journey, people who I have watched grow up with me and people who I have become friends with outside of rugby league. I absolutely love watching the Eagles and plan to do so for a very long time, going to games even through the years where we haven't always played in Sheffield, you see people and you talk to friends who share your passion, you hear and see them change and you watch them bring their own kids to the matches. Sheffield Eagles is way more than just a club they are a family and a group of people who share the excitement and banter that comes with cheering on your favourite teams. I can't wait for what our future holds as a club it's going to be amazing to watch the Eagles again in our home town and watch as our support grows and so does the family. I have invited friends to become season ticket holders too because I want them to experience the joy and elation that you get from watching your team play through the ups and downs. Often they can't believe how different it is to watching the football (with the two teams dominating our city) being able to sit down with the players in a pub or the head coach, they can see that again you become a part of this family feeling where you want them to play well and achieve greatness because it becomes a lot more than just a sport.",,,"I think as per my other comments rugby league is about getting as many people involved as possible, especially the younger generation so that the rugby league can become more popular for years to come. I think this project will give people who probably don't even know their are two versions of rugby being played that it's an amazing sport to watch with a friendly and fun atmosphere. People need to be more aware about rugby league and what it does for our communities, things like this project will bring to light how brilliant it is to watch a club that brings people from all walks of life together, but also how they help our cities off the field. Hearing the history and heritage of the sport will be something that even I will be interested to read because I know for a fact there will be many other stories that are similar to my own and very different ones too."," I think rugby league is for everyone but the problem is not a lot of people know about it, in this wonderful sporting city we call a home, every sport needs to have their voice heard and it's time for rugby league to be a part of that. Teaching kids what it feels like to be part of a team and educating people on other aspects of rugby like how we stand for equality and don't stand for any sort of homophobic, racial or sexist abuse. It's a different culture to other sports but it still has the passion and the banter, just in a way all ages can enjoy and be involved in. I want everyone to know what rugby league is and I want everyone to be able to say 'did you watch that rugby league game at the weekend, it was so good!' but at the moment I don't feel people know and that's a shame because I love the sport and I wish more people did.",,,16-25,White,S20,,,

# LO1. Understand the purpose and stages of data analysis and design

## P1
Explain the types of data that can be
analysed

Learners should explain the four different data types identified in the [teaching content](/content%2F1.1%20Data%20types.md), using appropriate examples they have researched. This can be
in the form of a guide for new IT learners, a presentation with speaker notes or a report.


## P2
Summarise the stages of data analysis
(* Synoptic assessment from Unit 1
Fundamentals of IT, Unit 2 Global
information)

Learners must summarise all of the stages of data analysis to include purpose and relevance of each stage to the production of useful and cost
effective data. This could be presented as a presentation with speaker notes, a report or a guide to data analysts.

## M1
Explain the importance of accurately
identifying information requirements
prior to data collection

Learners could use actual examples to highlight the importance of recognising the information requirements of a specific business need prior to data
collection. Research may identify only issues arising from poor requirements planning but learners would be able to use such examples to emphasise the
importance of accurately identifying requirements. This may take the form of a report or a presentation with speaker notes or a video presentation.

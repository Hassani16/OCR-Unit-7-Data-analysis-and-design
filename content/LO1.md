# LO1 Tasks : Understand the purpose and stages of data analysis and design

## P1 : Task
### What Data Types can be analysed ? : A guide for new IT learners

Explain the four different data types identified in the [teaching content](/content%2F1-1%20Data%20types/Intro.md), using appropriate examples you have researched. The audience is Y9 & 10 Students. 

## P2 : Task
### The stages of data analysis : A presentation with speaker notes 

A presentation (with speaker notes) summarising all 7 of the stages of [data analysis](/content%2F1-2%20Stages%20of%20data%20analysis.ipynb), to include purpose and relevance of each stage to the production of useful and cost
effective data. The audience is Y9 & 10 Students.

## M1 : Task
### The importance of accurately identifying information requirements prior to data collection : A presentation with speaker notes 
A presentation (with speaker notes) explaining the [importance of accurately identifying information requirements](/content/1-3%20Importance%20of%20accurately%20defining%20information%20requirements.md)) prior to data collection. Use actual examples to highlight the importance of recognising the information requirements of a specific business need prior to data collection. 


# The Types of Document

## A guide for new IT learners



### Suggestions of software / format
* Webpage (will need to be printable and savable for off line)
* Word doc / PDF


## A presentation with speaker notes 


# Spec : LO1 Understand the purpose and stages of data analysis and design

## P1
Explain the types of data that can be  analysed

### Guidance
Learners should explain the four different data types identified in the [teaching content](/content%2F1-1%20Data%20types/Intro.md), using appropriate examples they have researched. This can be
in the form of a guide for new IT learners, a presentation with speaker notes or a report.


## P2
Summarise the stages of data analysis (* Synoptic assessment from Unit 1 Fundamentals of IT, Unit 2 Global information)

### Guidance
Learners must summarise all of the stages of data analysis to include purpose and relevance of each stage to the production of useful and cost
effective data. This could be presented as a presentation with speaker notes, a report or a guide to data analysts.

## M1
Explain the importance of accurately identifying information requirements prior to data collection

### Guidance
Learners could use actual examples to highlight the importance of recognising the information requirements of a specific business need prior to data collection. Research may identify only issues arising from poor requirements planning but learners would be able to use such examples to emphasise the importance of accurately identifying requirements. This may take the form of a report or a presentation with speaker notes or a video presentation.

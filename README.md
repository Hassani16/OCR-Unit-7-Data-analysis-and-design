# Unit-7-Data-analysis-and-design
Planning and materials for OCR Cambridge Technical : Unit 7 : Data analysis and design

## UNIT AIM

This unit will enable you to develop the skills and knowledge required to actively use data
analysis techniques to provide evidence and interpretation for decision making for a range
of organisational needs. Organisations and individuals collect both quantitative and
qualitative data and store it for current or future use. The data analyst examines, cleanses,
transforms and models data in order to support decision making and understanding.

This unit is mandatory to the Data Analyst specialist pathway in the Level 3 Diploma suite
of qualifications due to its relevance in conducting data analysis and design solutions to
meet business requirements. The unit supports the development of skills, knowledge and
understanding relevant to the role of a data analyst and the techniques required.



## TEACHING CONTENT
The teaching content in every unit states what has to be taught to ensure that learners are able to
access the highest grades.

Anything which follows an i.e. details what must be taught as part of that area of content. Anything
which follows an e.g. is illustrative, it should be noted that where e.g. is used, learners must know
and be able to apply relevant examples in their work, although these do not need to be the same
ones specified in the unit content.

For internally assessed units you need to ensure that any assignments you create, or any
modifications you make to an assignment, do not expect the learner to do more than they have
been taught, but must enable them to access the full range of grades as described in the grading
criteria.

## Learning outcomes & Teaching content
The Learner will: 

### 1. Understand the purpose and stages of data analysis and design

Learners must be taught:

#### 1.1 Data types, i.e.:
* qualitative
* quantitative
* structured
* unstructured

#### 1.2 Stages of data analysis, i.e.:
* investigate information requirements (e.g. market share,
particulates in the air, testing of new drugs)
* data collection (e.g. observations, interviews, review of existing
data)
* data organisation (e.g. digitalisation, transcription, sorting, data
mining)
* data storage (e.g. in–house, external)
* data cleansing (e.g. errors, missing elements, duplicates)
* data manipulation (e.g. arranging, collating, aggregating,
interpreting, correlation)
* presentation of findings (e.g. tables, charts, graphs, dashboard,
reports)

#### 1.3 Importance of accurately defining information requirements, e.g.:
* prevents time wasting
* aids planning of:
  * data capture
  * data organisation and storage
  * cleaning and manipulation
  * presentation of results


### 2. Be able to investigate client requirements for data analysis

#### 2.1 Investigate information requirements 
(e.g. business intelligence,
scientific research, medical research, political)

#### 2.2 Techniques 
(e.g. holding focus groups, preparing and distributing
questionnaires and surveys to stakeholders, analysing current
documents)

#### 2.3 Qualitative data analysis, i.e.:
* typology (e.g. activities, actions, relationships)
* event analysis
* logical analysis (e.g. flow charts, flow diagrams)

#### 2.4 Quantitative data analysis i.e.:
* mean
* median
* standard deviation
* range

### 3. Be able to develop data design solutions to meet business requirements

#### 3.1 Levels of data model design, i.e.:
* conceptual: relationship between entities
* enterprise: unique business requirements
* logical: specific entities, attributes and relationship in a business
function
* physical: application and database specific implementation of
the logical data model

#### 3.2 Phases of logical data modelling, i.e.:

* structure – set of rules (e.g. entities, attributes, relationships,
queries)
* manipulating (e.g. updating, retrieving, editing or deletion of
content)
* integrity – validation of accuracy

### 4. Be able to present data analysis and design solutions to stakeholders

#### 4.1 Data design documentation, e.g.:
* data flow diagrams (DFDs)
* information flow charts
* entity attribute relationship diagram (EARD)
* hierarchical tree diagram
* events
* entity life history (ELH)

#### 4.2 Presentation of solution, e.g.:
* reflects all aspects of design
* can be understood by audience (e.g. level of technical jargon
used)
* format (e.g. report or presentation supported by diagrams or
models)

#### 4.3 Evaluation of design solution 
(e.g. meets business requirements,
achievable, manageable, extendable)
